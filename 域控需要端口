Active Directory and Active Directory Domain Services Port Requirements
Applies To: Windows Server 2000, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2003 with SP1, Windows Server 2003 with SP2, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 Foundation, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Vista
This guide contains port requirements for various Active Directory® and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) components. Both writable domain controllers and read-only domain controllers (RODCs) have the same port requirements. For more information about RODCs, see Designing RODCs in the Perimeter Network.
Default dynamic port range
In a domain that consists of Windows Server® 2003–based domain controllers, the default dynamic port range is 1025 through 5000. Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008, in compliance with Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) recommendations, increased the dynamic port range for connections. The new default start port is 49152, and the new default end port is 65535. Therefore, you must increase the remote procedure call (RPC) port range in your firewalls. If you have a mixed domain environment that includes a Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008 server and Windows Server 2003, allow traffic through ports 1025 through 5000 and 49152 through 65535.
When you see “TCP Dynamic” in the Protocol and Port column in the following table, it refers to ports 1025 through 5000, the default port range for Windows Server 2003, and ports 49152 through 65535, the default port range beginning with Windows Server 2008.
Note
For more information about the change in the dynamic port range beginning in Windows Server 2008, see article 929851 in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=153117). 
You can find additional information about this change on the Ask the Directory Services Team blog. See the blog entry Dynamic Client Ports in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=153113). 
Restricting RPC to a specific port
RPC traffic is used over a dynamic port range as described in the previous section, “Default dynamic port range.” To restrict RPC traffic to a specific port, see article 224196 in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=133489).
Communication to Domain Controllers
The following table lists the port requirements for establishing DC to DC communication in all versions of Windows Sever beginning with Windows Server 2003.
Additional ports are required for communication between a read-only domain controller (RODC) and a writeable DC.
